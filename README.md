# FYP-Machine-learning-based-trading
The objective of this project is to design and develop machine learning-based trading
strategies for various financial markets. We aim to first start with non-machine
learning techniques, including statistical arbitrage trading and defensive portfolio
strategy. Then, we will do machine learning-based strategies, such as multiple
classifier trading, clustering-based pairs trading, reinforcement learning trading, and
RNN-based portfolio optimization. We will backtest each of these strategies using
historical data to evaluate their performance and determine their potential for use in
real-world trading scenarios. After the backtesting, a trading system is developed for
the real-time trading environment.
Specifically, we aim to achieve the following objectives in non-machine learning
research, machine learning research, and software development:<br>
A. Non-machine learning models
1. Investigate and evaluate the effectiveness of statistical arbitrage pair trading
strategies, which seek to profit from mispricings in the market using
quantitative models.
2. Develop defensive portfolio optimization strategies which seek to optimize the
portfolio using mathematical models.<br>

B. Machine Learning models
1. The Multiple Model-based Strategies iterate through most sci-kit-learn
models, with the comparison of classifiers and regressors predictions. With
more granular feedback, this model is useful for badly defined classes with
unclear decision boundaries.
2. Investigate the effectiveness of clustering-based pairs trading strategies,
including K-means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, and Affinity
Propagation, which group similar stocks together and identify trading
opportunities based on the relationship between them.
3. Develop and test reinforcement learning-based trading strategies, including
Markov Decision Process, and deep Q Learning network to optimize trading
decisions based on market conditions and investor preferences.
4. Develop and test RNN-based portfolio optimization strategies, which leverage
temporal dependencies in financial data to optimize portfolio allocations and
maximize returns.<br>

C. Software Development
1. Build a Trading Server as an order management system to handle orders
placed by different models
2. Develop a Restful API Server to handle data creation and requests from the
user interface
3. Develop a user interface for simple user control of adding models and
monitoring model performance<br>

Through these objectives, we aim to design and develop a comprehensive trading
system that incorporates multiple machine-learning techniques and can effectively
generate trading signals for a range of financial markets.
